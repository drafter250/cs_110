                    <h2>Knitted Tank Top (Striped Top)</h2>
                    <p>Knitted summer of 2016, made with Yarn Co., 50% cotton, 50% acrylic, will fit a 42’-44’ bust.&nbsp;&nbsp;I designed this tank myself to wear for the summer.  It has a nice loose fit and drape which is nice for the hot summer weather.&nbsp;&nbsp;The textured seed stitch works up nice in the strip pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;The yarn was dyed to stripe in that color sequence which makes it fun to knit with.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to wear it with some capris and a cute pair of sandals.</p>

                    <h2>Crochet Hairpin Lace Cowl</h2>

                    <p>Knitted summer of 2017, made with Studio Samples by Nicole, 90% acrylic, 10% polyester, approximately 32" around.  I stumbled upon this cowl by accident.  I was just using this yarn to test out a new hairpin lace loom I got and a pattern stitch I was interested in and it turned into something rather pretty.  The yarn works up in a nice purple to white strip and the ripple stitch makes the cowl look really elegant.  The hairpin lace makes a lightweight cowl that will be nice for the cooler autumn weather.</p>
