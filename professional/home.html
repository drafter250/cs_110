            <p>Hi, I’m Tyna also known as Knittygirl.  I’m a stay-at-home mom of two boys. I am crazy about yarn and knitting (and crochet, too)!!  I taught myself how to knit about 12 years ago while I was deployed to Iraq.  I worked as a combat medic in the Army and during my down time in the hospital I worked in, I would knit.  It was a great help to deal with all the difficult things I had to see while I was there.</p><br />

            <p>I learned to crochet from my grandmother who made the most amazing crochet blankets.  She taught me the basics and I learned other skills on my own.  Please check out my site to learn new skills, buy my knit and crochet items, and increase your joy of knitting and crochet.</p><br />

            <p>I have a number of my most favorite projects for sale in my <a href="store.html">Store</a>
            I also work on commission when time permits. Take a look at My <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> and <a href="store.html">Store</a>.
            If there is something you like in my Portfolio that is not in the <a href="store.html">Store</a> please use the custom request form and I will get back to you with my availability.
            </p>
