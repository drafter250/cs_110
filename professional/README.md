## background
I am currently a Draftsman at a major aerospace company in Connecticut. I am responsible for creating 3d models and drawings for some mechanical parts that require a lot of data and information to properly define them. The large amount of data I have to manage in my work led me to teach myself the Python programming language for which there is a rich ecosystem of open source data analysis tools available. I have developed a number of tools in python that need a user interface. While i could use some of the desktop based UI kits for building User Interfaces, having local tools running on multiple desktop machines is difficult to manage.

## Professional Site Intro
 My Wife is dedicated to being a stay at home mom while our two boys are still young. She
 is also an avid knitter and fiber artist. While her primary focus is giving our two boys the best head-start they can get in life she dreams one day of having her own business based on knitting and other fiber arts. When I told her the main assignment for this class was building a professional web-site she pretty much decided for me what i was going to be building... a future business/portfolio site for her!

The basic features we agreed upon were:

* Home Page
* Blog page
* Portfolio page
* Store page

The Home Page was pretty straight forward. It's just an intro to the site and an overview of its features. Most Important to her was that the site share the same header and hat
