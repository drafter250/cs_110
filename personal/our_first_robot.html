        <h2>Our First Robot</h2>
        <p>I have two young boys the oldest, Stephen is six and the younger, Seth is three years old. My six year old Stephen, is currently obsessed with all things robots. I have resisted the urge to go buy an arduino or rasberry pi robotics kit or even a lego mindstorms because I know he is still a little too young to have the attention span to stick with doing anything worthwhile with one (although I would love to have one I just don't have the time either)</p>
        <p>Well a few weeks ago My wife found this book at our local library</p>

        <p> The book has a number of simple projects for using various scrap bit's and pieces of various toys to hack together something new and interesting. The project I chose to try with Stephen was a vibrating bot with some kind of writing instrument for legs that would draw paterns on a piece of paper.</p>
        <p>And Here is the final Product.</p>

        <p>One of the only things I did not have on hand was a battery holder for a 9 volt battery. Since I started the project in the morning with a six year old and three year old eagerly waiting to see their new creation come to life I had to find some place to get one fast. Remembering that Radio-Shack is no longer around a quick google search revealed a place on the berlin turnpike (rt 15 in Connecticut) called <a href="http://www.cablesandconnectors.com/">Cables & Connectors Inc</a>.</p>
        <p>There I found a smorgasboard of electronic components and ammong them this litle gem for less than 5 bucks. It's a 9-Volt Battery holder with an integrated on-off switch... SWEET!</p>

        <p>This is the motor from one of many old rc cars I had in a box. To make the bot vibrate the motor needs to rotate something off-balance. Heating up the shaft enough to melt a piece of glue stick onto it lopsided did the trick.</p>

        <p>After some solder and zip ties here it is... their reaction from the first time they turn it on</p>
