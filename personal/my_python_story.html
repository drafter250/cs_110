        <h2>My Python Story - How I learned to code in Python</h2>
        <p>I have no formal experience with computer science. I am a Mechanical Draftsman but the types of parts I deal with on a day to day basis in my day-job have a lot of data related with them. This data is usualy in the form of one obscure text file format or another. Eventualy the need arises to edit those files. At some point I found notepad++ is to be an invaluable tool! as time went on I started making macro's to do repetitive things.</p>
        <p>Then I learned about regular expression searches in notepad++ and started figuring out how to search and replace things based on patterns of numbers and characters rather than specific search terms. However that was no longer enough when I realized that I needed to increment the replacement text. For example a file might contain groups of data and those groups start with a label that looks like "A-A", "B-B", "C-C" and so on. Then another data file might use the same labeling scheme but maybe whoever created that file might have started with "C-C". Now the labels need to be re-aligned so that some computer program could read them together properly.</p>
        <p>This is when I started asking around at work about how to solve this problem and a lot of people said a programing language like "Perl" is what was needed. I spent about two or three days looking at Perl documentation and my brain went Numb every time I tried to get started. So I started looking for an alternative. While doing some research I found that a lot of my favorite Open Source applications like, <a href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a>, <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender - 3D animation<a> and <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp the GNU Image Manipulation Program</a> all used Python as a scripting interface. I went to work the next day looked around the network and found a somewhat old version of Python. After that I started searching for tutorials online and was overwhelmed! There were so many! I was immediatly amazed by how easy it was to almost read and understand the code and very quickly get the basic idea's.</p>
        <p>Even though I am a Draftsman I use Python scripts that I have made almost every day and I can't imagine what I would do without them.</p>
